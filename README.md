Welcome to the Build a Kitty Cat Simulator Game!

Hello, this is the creator Inaya! I love cats and wanted to create a fun little game about them so here it is!!

I created an interactive Python script that allows you to design your custom kitty using a series of questions that deduct money from a given budget of 100 dollars. At the end of the game, you can see how well you managed your funds and enjoy your personalized cat creation!

How to Run the Game:

1)Copy and paste code into a new .py file in VS code 2)Instead of clicking the play button, click the dropdown arrow next to it and select "Run Python File in Dedicated Terminal".

OR if that does not work:

1)Download the Script: 2)Download the Python file consolidationproject2.py to your computer or laptop. 3)Run in VS Code: 4)Open VS Code and navigate to the directory where you saved consolidationproject2.py 5)Instead of clicking the play button, click the dropdown arrow next to it and select "Run Python File in Dedicated Terminal".

OR if that does not work:

1)Run using Command Line: 2)Open your terminal or command prompt. 3)Navigate to the directory where you downloaded consolidationproject2.py 4)Run the script by typing python consolidationproject2.py and press enter. 5)Make sure that Python is installed on your system!

How to Play:

The game will start automatically once you run the script. You must enter your username to personalize the game. Then you must respond to each question by typing the appropriate number or letter and press enter. (It will guide you, and redirect if incorrect.) As the user you have to manage your initial budget of $100 to make choices about your catâ€™s features. Enjoy the transitions between questions and watch the credits at the end before viewing your data analysis chart at the end which details all of your spending choices and how much they cost you. Also including how much you have in your budget by the end. 

Game Features:

I chose binary answers for simplicity: choose between given options to spend your budget. Real-time budget updates: keep track of your funds after each decision. Surprise elements: special offers at the end appear, providing additional choices.

In-Game Limitations:

The game currently supports only predefined answers for simplicity. The questions are kind of structured similarly and may not cover a broad range of customization due to time limitations. The script requires user input to proceed, so it cannot run on its own.
